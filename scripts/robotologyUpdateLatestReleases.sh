# Script to automatically update the latest.releases.yaml file
# With the latest tag done on the stable branches of a given repo

# To run it locally, download yq binary from https://github.com/mikefarah/yq
# rename it to yq, and put it in a directory that you add to the path.
# Then, navigate to robotology-superbuild dir and execute in Bash:
# ./scripts/robotologyUpdateLatestReleases.sh
# Warning: if you run, it will update the tags only of the repos
# that are enabled and downloaded, so it is intendend to run after all the
# components and options have been enabled, and after the update-all target
# has been run

# This array contains the project that for a given reason should not be updated by this script
# ICUBcontrib is here as it has several coincident tags, and the script currently is not able
# to get the last one
# External repos are in the list as we updated them manually
# event-driven does not have a recent release
