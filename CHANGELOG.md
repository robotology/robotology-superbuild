- Add `casadi-matlab-bindings` package containing the MATLAB bindings for CasADi. The package is enabled if ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS_FULL_DEPS is ON and ROBOTOLOGY_USES_MATLAB is ON (https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/pull/747).
- Add `matlab-whole-body-simulator` package (https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/pull/689).

### Removed
- The `icub-gazebo` project was removed from the superbuild (https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/pull/646).
- The `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_MATLAB` is not enable in Windows/vcpkg installer. Windows binaries for MATLAB/Simulink projects are avalable in Windows/conda, including in the form of One-line installation script (https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/blob/master/doc/matlab-one-line-install.md, https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/pull/775).

## [2021.02] - 2021-02-25

### Changed
- All the subproject repos are now cloned in `robotology-superbuild/src` and the corresponding build directories are created in `robotology-superbuild/build/src` ( https://github.com/robotology/community/discussions/451 ).
- iDynTree is now compiled with the `IDYNTREE_USES_IRRLICHT` option. As a consequence, [`irrlicht`](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) has been added as a dependency on all supported platforms (https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/pull/618).
- The `GAZEBO_YARP_PLUGINS_HAS_OPENCV` CMake option of `gazebo-yarp-plugins` is now set to `ON` (https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/pull/619).
