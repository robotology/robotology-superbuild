# Install Mambaforge

This page used to contain detailed documentation on how to install the `mambaforge` conda distribution.

However, as of July 2024 `mambaforge` has been deprecated and all its functionalities are part of the `miniforge` distributions, and new `mambaforge` installers will not be released from January 2025.

For this reason, please install `miniforge`, referring to the instructions in [`install-miniforge.md`](./install-miniforge.md) page.
