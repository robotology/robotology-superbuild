# This is a small hack. To avoid incompatibilities between the version tagged in the robotology-dependencies fork
# (something like 3.2.0.1) and the version available in conda-forge when generating conda metapackages
# such as robotology-distro and robotology-distro-all, we override the conda package version of qpOASES
# here. This needs to be removed as soon as we stop use our fork in the superbuild
